## gameplay

* This is a basic RPG game

* Selecta character to play as your character, the rest becomes your opponents

* Select a character to attack, and then press the attack button to attack

* Each time you attack, your attack power increases

## development

* Each charater had to be assigned hp, attack and counterAttack values, these values were stored in objects.

* Event listeners needed to be added, and the DOM had to be manipulated based on clicks, with objects being shown and hidden based on selections, in order to select which characters were intitial players and subsequent attackers. If statments determined whether selected characters became the selected player or attackers. 

* A function for attack power increasing had to be written and connected to clicks of the attack button. The variable ahd to be updated to inform subsequent attacks.

* A function had to be written for subtracting the newly formed attack power from the HP.
